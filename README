The repository provides a project to log ADC measurements from an ATSAMD10 to the PC.

The project is based on the DefaultSAMD10Project repository.
Files in the "AtmelFiles" directory are taken from the Atmel Software Framework (v3.25.0.20).

The project is setup for the ATSAMD10D14AS.  To use another processor in the ATSAMD10 family, the following project properties need to be modified:
	C/C++ Build->Settings->Cross ARM C Compiler->Preprocessor->Defined symbols
	C/C++ Build->Settings->Cross ARM C Linker->General->Script Files

Project dependecies:
	arm-none-eabi-binutils-cs
	arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs
	arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs-c++
	arm-none-eabi-newlib
